# TorrentSwitch: Tie multiple torrent managers into one simple tool
A program that links multiple torrent clients into a simple manager. This allows users to add multiple torrent managers which are running on different systems/devices.
Adding multiple instances of the same torrent manager are possible, allowing the user to set multiple download folders, something many torrent managers do not support.

##What this program does not do 
Download files/torrents

## Usage
TorrentSwitch can be associated with torrent files and magnet links.
On first start a client or multiple clients need to be added so the program have something to work with. 
Each new client creates a new column in the main dataGrid. 
When openning a torrent or magnet link the program recognizes it and loads the file/link. From there the user can choose where to forward the torrent from the avalaible clients.

This project is based on the [BencodeNet library](https://github.com/Krusen/BencodeNET).
