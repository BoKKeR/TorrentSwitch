# TorrentSwitch
Simple program to link multiple torrent clients into a simple torrent manager program. This allows users to add multiple torrent managers which are running on different platforms/hw.
Adding multiple instances of the same torrent manager are possible too allowing the user to set multiple download folders, something many torrent managers seem to not support.

# Usage

When openning a torrent or magnet link the program recognizes it and loads the file/link. From there the user can choose which torrent manager to use to  actually download the torrent.
